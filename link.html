		<p>‘Branching’ is a feature of Git that allows a project to move in multiple different directions simultaneously. There is one master branch that is always usable, but any number of new branches can be created to develop new features. Once ready, these branches can then be merged back into master.
		When working in a Git repository, HEAD refers to the current branch being worked on. When a different branch is ‘checked out’, the HEAD changes to indicate the new working branch.

		<p>When merging a branch back into master, there is the possibility for merge conflicts to arise. These can be resolved in the same way discussed in Lecture 0.
		Some Git commands related to branching:

    	git branch : list all the branches currently in a repository
    	git branch <name> : create a new branch called name
    	git checkout <name> : switch current working branch to name
    	git merge <name> : merge branch name into current working branch (normally master)

		Any version of a repository that is not stored locally on a device is called a ‘remote’. ‘Origin’ is used to refer to the remote from which the local repository was originally downloaded from.
		Some Git commands related to remotes:

    	git fetch : download all of the latest commits from a remote to a local device
    	git merge origin/master : merge origin/master, which is the remote version of a repository normally downloaded with git fetch, into the local, preexesiting master branch
        Note that git pull is equivalent to running git fetch and then git merge origin/master
